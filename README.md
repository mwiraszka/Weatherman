# Weatherman
<i>Reporting the weather. Saving lives.</i>
<hr><br>

[Weatherman](https://www.weatherman-mwiraszka.vercel.app) is a desktop application generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) (version 11.2.3) and deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The app retrieves the current weather for any inputted location –– either by city name or postcode –– through requests to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/)' APIs. Weatherman features a fully-responsive frontend design, leveraging Angular Material and Flexbox, as well as an intuitive UX through its robust form validators and search-as-you-type functionality.
